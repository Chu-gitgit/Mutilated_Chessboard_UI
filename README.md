The **mutilated chessboard problem** is a [tiling puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_puzzle) proposed by philosopher [Max Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Black) in his book *Critical Thinking* (1946). It was later discussed by [Solomon W. Golomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_W._Golomb) (1954), [Gamow & Stern (1958)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem#CITEREFGamowStern1958) and by [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner) in his *[Scientific American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American)* column "[Mathematical Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Games)". The problem is as follows:

> Suppose a standard 8×8 [chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard) has two diagonally opposite corners removed, leaving 62 squares. Is it possible to place 31 [dominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes) of size 2×1 so as to cover all of these squares?

Most considerations of this problem in literature provide solutions "in the conceptual sense" without proofs.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem#cite_note-1) [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)) proposed it as a hard problem for [automated proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_proof) systems.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem#cite_note-2) In fact, its solution using the [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)) system of inference is exponentially hard.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem#cite_note-3)
